Introduction:
As the used car market continues to evolve, dealers face increasing pressure to optimize their inventory to remain competitive. In this report, we present the results of our analysis aimed at assisting used car dealers in fine-tuning their inventory. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, we have identified key insights and recommendations to improve inventory management practices.
Methodology:
Our analysis involved three main stages:
* 		Data Collection: We gathered a comprehensive dataset containing information on used cars, including features such as mileage, age, brand, location, and price.
* 		Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and car prices.
* 		Model Development: Using machine learning techniques, we developed predictive models to forecast car prices based on various features.
Findings:
* 		Impact of Mileage and Age: Our analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between mileage/age and car prices. Newer cars with lower mileage tend to command higher prices in the market.
* 		Brand Influence: Certain brands exhibit a significant impact on car prices, with luxury brands often commanding higher prices compared to economy brands.
* 		Regional Disparities: Location emerged as a crucial factor influencing car prices, with variations observed across different regions. Urban areas tend to have higher average prices compared to rural areas.
* 		Model Performance: Our predictive models demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting car prices, with performance metrics indicating robust predictive capabilities.
Recommendations:
* 		Optimize Inventory Mix: Focus on stocking a balanced mix of cars across different brands, ages, and mileage ranges to cater to diverse customer preferences.
* 		Price Adjustment Strategies: Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on factors such as mileage, age, and regional demand to maximize profitability.
* 		Market Segmentation: Segment the market based on customer preferences and regional differences to tailor inventory offerings accordingly.
