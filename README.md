For my independent study, I examined the acceptance rates of carry out coupons among drivers. I explored various factors such as frequency of carryout, age, income, passenger type, destination, and time of day to understand the characteristics of drivers who are more likely to accept carry out coupons.

Frequency of Carry Out:
Analysis reveals a higher acceptance rate among individuals who purchase carryout more than three times a month (75.35%) compared to those with three or fewer monthly orders (72.37%). Interestingly, the frequency of carryout orders does not significantly impact acceptance rates.

Age:
Similar to above, there doesn't seem to be a significant difference in acceptance rates based on age alone. However, when considering drivers who get carry out more than three times a month, there might be a slightly higher acceptance rate among those under the age of 30 (74.07%).

Income and Restaurant Preferences:
Among drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than three times a month and have an income less than $50K, there appears to be a higher acceptance rate (75.77%). This suggests that drivers with lower income levels may be more inclined to accept carry out coupons.

Passenger Type:
Passenger type does seem to influence the acceptance rates of carry out coupons. Drivers who are with their partner tend to have a slightly lower acceptance rate (71.74%) compared to those with friends (75.95%) or alone (73.19%). Surprisingly, drivers with kids in the car have the lowest acceptance rate at 69.72%. This suggests that individuals alone or with friends might be more receptive to carry out coupons compared to those driving with their partner or children.

Destination:
The destination of the driver appears to significantly influence the acceptance rates of carry out coupons. Drivers whose destination is 'Home' have the highest acceptance rate, with 79.19% of coupons being accepted. Similarly, drivers heading to 'No Urgent Place' also have a relatively high acceptance rate, with 76.15% of coupons being accepted. On the other hand, drivers heading to 'Work' have a noticeably lower acceptance rate, with only 66.12% of coupons being accepted. This suggests that individuals are more likely to accept carry out coupons when they are not in a hurry or when they are heading home.

Time of Day:
The time of day also appears to influence the acceptance rates of carry out coupons. The acceptance rate varies throughout the day, with the highest acceptance rate observed around 2 PM (86.60%) and the lowest around 7 AM (66.12%). Additionally, the acceptance rates are relatively high during the evening hours, with acceptance rates of 70.00% at 10 AM, 76.77% at 10 PM, and 82.08% at 6 PM. This suggests that drivers are more likely to accept carry out coupons during midday and evening hours compared to early morning.

In this independent study, I investigated the acceptance rates of carry out coupons among drivers, considering factors such as frequency of carry out, age, income, passenger type, destination, and time of day. While some variables like age and frequency of carry out orders showed limited impact on acceptance rates, others such as income, passenger type, destination, and time of day played significant roles.

Next Steps and Recommendations:
Moving forward, I recommend the company to focus their marketing efforts on drivers more likely to accept carryout coupons based on the identified patterns. This includes targeting drivers with lower incomes, those traveling alone or with friends, and during peak acceptance times, particularly around 2 PM and during the evening hours. Additionally, continuous monitoring and analysis of coupon performance can provide valuable insights for refining promotional campaigns and improving overall effectiveness.
